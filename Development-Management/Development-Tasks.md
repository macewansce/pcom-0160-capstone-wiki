## Development Management

### Work Tracking

Each team member is expected to demonstrate their work by following the principles of Agile methodology. This includes the following workflow:

1. Participate in Daily Scrum (usually one session per sprint)
2. Discuss sprint backlog with group lead and/or team lead
3. Identify what you will work on for this sprint
4. Locate the User Story related to the work you will be doing and create one or more Tasks that will be assigned to you to complete (you may need to create a new User Story if you are researching a design idea or extending the base functionality)
5. Refresh your local repository from your remote repository and work on implementing this functionality
6. Add and Commit locally, then Push to your remote repository
7. When your tasks are complete work with your team leader to create a Pull Request to your team branch



### Work Item Definitions

For most Agile projects, we define the work item categories like this:

* Epic
  * A large body of work that can be broken down into multiple features
* Feature
  * A significant piece of functionality that delivers value to the user
* User Story
  * Something a user can do, a smaller piece of functionality
* Task
  * A unit of work to implement another work item, usually associated with User Stories
* Bug
  * Used to track a code defect, often linked to a test result or a user story
* Issue
  * Used to track project elements that can effect the work being completed

We use Epics, Features, and User Stories to help logically group bits of our applications and functionality into a reasonable hierarchy. It helps us manage the work and communicate clearly. We then use tasks to split the work we are doing to provide granularity for team members to work against.



### Creating Tasks

The capstone project has a set of Epics, Features, and User Stories already in place to help define the structure and functionality of the To Do app we are creating together. To create a Task against a User Story, 



In order to receive your attendance and participation credits you are expected to produce the following artifacts at least once per sprint:

Azure DevOps Task linked to a User Story, directly related to the work assigned to you by your team lead
One or more Commits to your remote repository and optionally to your team repository via a Pull Request
Linking of these Commits to the related Tasks
