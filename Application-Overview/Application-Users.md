## User Management

The To Do application supports user registration and roles based access.

Once a user with the role of **Administrator** is logged into the system, they should have the ability to perform the following functions:


### View User List

The user management area should display a list of users of the system. There should be the ability for the administrator to create a new user. Any listed users should have the ability to view the user details or delete the user.
